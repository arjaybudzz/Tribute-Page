          As a teenager, Kasparov tied for first place in the USSR Chess Championship in 1981-82. His first win in a
          superid-level international tournament was scored at Bugojno, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yugoslavia in 1982.
          He earned a place in the 1982 Moscow Interzonal tournament, which he won, to qualify for the Candidates
          Tournament. At age 19, he was the youngest Candidate since Bobby Fischer, who was 15 when he qualified in
          1958. At this stage, he was already the No. 2-rated player in the world, trailing only World Chess Champion
          Anatoly Karpov on the January 1983 list.
          Kasparov's first (quarter-final) Candidates match was against Alexander Beliavsky, whom he defeated 6-3 (four
          wins, one loss). Politics threatened Kasparov's semi-final against Viktor Korchnoi, which was scheduled to be
          played in Pasadena, California. Korchnoi had defected from the Soviet Union in 1976 and was at that time the
          strongest active non-Soviet player. Various political manoeuvres prevented Kasparov from playing Korchnoi, and
          Kasparov forfeited the match. This was resolved by Korchnoi allowing the match to be replayed in London, along
          with the previously scheduled match between Vasily Smyslov and Zoltán Ribli. The Kasparov-Korchnoi match was
          put together on short notice by Raymond Keene. Kasparov lost the first game but won the match 7-4 (four wins,
          one loss).
          In January 1984, Kasparov became the No. 1 ranked player in the world, with a FIDE rating of 2710. He became
          the youngest ever world No. 1, a record that lasted 12 years until being broken by Vladimir Kramnik in January
          1996; the record is currently held by Magnus Carlsen.
          Later in 1984, he won the Candidates' final 8½-4½ (four wins, no losses) against the resurgent former world
          champion Vasily Smyslov, at Vilnius, thus qualifying to play Anatoly Karpov for the World Championship. That
          year he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), as a member of which he was elected to the
          Central Committee of Komsomol in 1987.
          The World Chess Championship 1984 match between Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov had many ups and downs, and
          a very controversial finish. Karpov started in very good form, and after nine games Kasparov was down 4-0 in a
          "first to six wins" match. Fellow players predicted he would be whitewashed 6-0 within 18 games.
          In an unexpected turn of events, there followed a series of 17 successive draws, some relatively short, and
          others drawn in unsettled positions. Kasparov lost game 27 (5-0), then fought back with another series of
          draws until game 32 (5-1), earning his first-ever win against the World Champion. Another 14 successive draws
          followed, through game 46; the previous record length for a world title match had been 34 games, the match of
          José Raúl Capablanca vs. Alexander Alekhine in 1927.
          Kasparov won games 47 and 48 to bring the scores to 5-3 in Karpov's favour. Then the match was ended without
          result by Florencio Campomanes, the President of the Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE), and a new
          match was announced to start a few months later. The termination was controversial, as both players stated
          that they preferred the match to continue. Announcing his decision at a press conference, Campomanes cited the
          health of the players, which had been strained by the length of the match.
          The match became the first, and so far only, world championship match to be abandoned without result.
          Kasparov's relations with Campomanes and FIDE were greatly strained, and the feud between them finally came to
          a head in 1993 with Kasparov's complete break-away from FIDE.
          The second Karpov-Kasparov match in 1985 was organized in Moscow as the best of 24 games where the first
          player to win 12½ points would claim the World Champion title. The scores from the terminated match would not
          carry over; however, in the event of a 12-12 draw, the title would remain with Karpov. On 9 November 1985,
          Kasparov secured the title by a score of 13-11, winning the 24th game with Black, using a Sicilian defence. He
          was 22 years old at the time, making him the youngest ever World Champion and breaking the record held by
          Mikhail Tal for over 20 years. Kasparov's win as Black in the 16th game has been recognized as one of the
          all-time masterpieces in chess history, including being voted the best game played during the first 64 issues
          of the magazine Chess Informant.
          As part of the arrangements following the aborted 1984 match, Karpov had been granted (in the event of his
          defeat) a right to rematch. Another match took place in 1986, hosted jointly in London and Leningrad, with
          each city hosting 12 games. At one point in the match, Kasparov opened a three-point lead and looked well on
          his way to a decisive match victory. But Karpov fought back by winning three consecutive games to level the
          score late in the match. At this point, Kasparov dismissed one of his seconds, grandmaster Evgeny Vladimirov,
          accusing him of selling his opening preparation to the Karpov team (as described in Kasparov's autobiography
          Unlimited Challenge, chapter Stab in the Back). Kasparov scored one more win and kept his title by a final
          score of 12½-11½.
          A fourth match for the world title took place in 1987 in Seville, as Karpov had qualified through the
          Candidates' Matches to again become the official challenger. This match was very close, with neither player
          holding more than a one-point lead at any time during the contest. Kasparov was down one full point at the
          time of the final game and needed a win to draw the match and retain his title. A long tense game ensued in
          which Karpov blundered away a pawn just before the first time control, and Kasparov eventually won a long
          ending. Kasparov retained his title as the match was drawn by a score of 12-12.
          The fifth match between Kasparov and Karpov was held in New York and Lyon in 1990, with each city hosting 12
          games. Again the result was a close one, with Kasparov winning by a margin of 12½-11½. In their five world
          championship matches, Kasparov had 21 wins, 19 losses, and 104 draws in 144 games.
