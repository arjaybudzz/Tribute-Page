      <div id="information">
        <p id="paragraph">
          After his retirement from chess in 2005, Kasparov turned to politics and created the United Civil Front, a
          social movement whose main goal is to "work to preserve electoral democracy in Russia". He has vowed to
          "restore democracy" to Russia by restoring the rule of law.
          Kasparov was instrumental in setting up The Other Russia, a coalition which opposes Putin's government. The
          Other Russia has been boycotted by the leaders of Russia's mainstream opposition parties, Yabloko and Union of
          Right Forces due to its inclusion of both nationalist and radical groups. Kasparov has criticized these groups
          as being secretly under the auspices of the Kremlin.
          In April 2005, Kasparov was in Moscow at a promotional event when he was struck over the head with a
          chessboard he had just signed. The assailant was reported to have said "I admired you as a chess player, but
          you gave that up for politics" immediately before the attack. Kasparov has been the subject of a number of
          other episodes since, including police brutality and alleged harassment from the Russian secret service.
          Kasparov helped organize the Saint Petersburg Dissenters' March on 3 March 2007 and The March of the
          Dissenters on 24 March 2007, both involving several thousand people rallying against Putin and Saint
          Petersburg Governor Valentina Matviyenko's policies.
          In April 2007, Kasparov led a pro-democracy demonstration in Moscow. Soon after the demonstration's start,
          however, over 9,000 police descended on the group and seized almost everyone. Kasparov, who was briefly
          arrested by the Moscow police, was warned by the prosecution office on the eve of the march that anyone
          participating risked being detained. He was held for some 10 hours and then fined and released. He was later
          summoned by the FSB for violations of Russian anti-extremism laws.
          Speaking about Kasparov, former KGB defector Oleg Kalugin in 2007 remarked, "I do not talk in details - people
          who knew them are all dead now because they were vocal, they were open. I am quiet. There is only one man who
          is vocal and he may be in trouble: [former] world chess champion [Garry] Kasparov. He has been very outspoken
          in his attacks on Putin and I believe that he is probably next on the list."
          Kasparov gave speeches at think tanks such as the Hoover Institution.
          On 30 September 2007, Kasparov entered the Russian presidential race, receiving 379 of 498 votes at a congress
          held in Moscow by The Other Russia. In October 2007, Kasparov announced his intention of standing for the
          Russian presidency as the candidate of the "Other Russia" coalition and vowed to fight for a "democratic and
          just Russia". Later that month he traveled to the United States, where he appeared on several popular
          television programs, which were hosted by Stephen Colbert, Wolf Blitzer, Bill Maher, and Chris Matthews.
          In November 2007, Kasparov and other protesters were detained by police at an Other Russia rally in Moscow,
          which drew 3,000 demonstrators to protest election rigging. Following an attempt by about 100 protesters to
          march through police lines to the electoral commission, which had barred Other Russia candidates from
          parliamentary elections, arrests were made. The Russian authorities stated a rally had been approved but not
          any marches, resulting in several detained demonstrators. He was subsequently charged with resisting arrest
          and organizing an unauthorized protest and given a jail sentence of five days. Kasparov appealed the charges,
          citing that he had been following orders given by the police, although it was denied. He was released from
          jail on 29 November. Putin criticized Kasparov at the rally for his use of English when speaking rather than
          Russian.
          In December 2007, Kasparov announced that he had to withdraw his presidential candidacy due to inability to
          rent a meeting hall where at least 500 of his supporters could assemble. With the deadline expiring on that
          date, he explained it was impossible for him to run. Russian election laws required sufficient meeting hall
          space for assembling supporters. Kasparov's spokeswoman accused the government of using pressure to deter
          anyone from renting a hall for the gathering and said that the electoral commission had rejected a proposal
          that would have allowed for smaller gathering sizes rather than one large gathering at a meeting hall.
          Kasparov was among the 34 first signatories and a key organizer of the online anti-Putin campaign "Putin must
          go", started on 10 March 2010. The campaign was begun by a coalition of opposition to Putin who regard his
          rule as lacking any rule of law. Within the text is a call to Russian law enforcement to ignore Putin's
          orders. By June 2011, there were 90,000 signatures. While the identity of the petition author remained
          anonymous, there was wide speculation that it was indeed Kasparov.
          Kasparov was named Chairman of the Human Rights Foundation in 2011.
          On 31 January 2012, Kasparov hosted a meeting of opposition leaders planning a mass march on 4 February 2012,
          the third major opposition rally held since the disputed State Duma elections of December 2011. Among other
          opposition leaders attending were Alexey Navalny and Yevgenia Chirikova.
          On 17 August 2012, Kasparov was arrested and beaten outside of the Moscow court while attending the sentencing
          in the case involving the all-female punk band Pussy Riot. On 24 August, he was cleared of charges that he
          took part in an unauthorized protest against the conviction of three members of Pussy Riot. Judge Yekaterina
          Veklich said there were "no grounds to believe the testimony of the police". He could still face criminal
          charges over a police officer's claims that the opposition leader bit his finger while he was being detained.
          He later thanked all the bloggers and reporters who provided video evidence that contradicted the testimony of
          the police.
          Kasparov wrote in February 2013 that "fascism has come to Russia. ...Project Putin, just like the old Project
          Hitler, is but the fruit of a conspiracy by the ruling elite. Fascist rule was never the result of the free
          will of the people. It was always the fruit of a conspiracy by the ruling elites!"
          In April 2013, Kasparov joined in an HRF condemnation of Kanye West for having performed for the leader of
          Kazakhstan in exchange for a $3 million paycheck, saying that West "has entertained a brutal killer and his
          entourage" and that his fee "came from the loot stolen from the Kazakhstan treasury".
          Kasparov denied rumors in April 2013 that he planned to leave Russia for good. "I found these rumors to be
          deeply saddening and, moreover, surprising," he wrote. "I was unable to respond immediately because I was in
          such a state of shock that such an incredibly inaccurate statement, the likes of which is constantly
          distributed by the Kremlin's propagandists, came this time from Ilya Yashin, a fellow member of the Opposition
          Coordination Council (KSO) and my former colleague from the Solidarity movement."
          In an April 2013 op-ed piece, Kasparov accused prominent Russian journalist Vladimir Posner of failing to
          stand up to Putin and to earlier Russian and Soviet leaders.
          Kasparov was presented with the Morris B. Abram Human Rights Award, UN Watch's annual human-rights prize, in
          2013. The organization praised him as "not only one of the world's smartest men" but "also among its bravest".
          At the 2013 Women in the World conference, Kasparov told The Daily Beast's Michael Moynihan that democracy no
          longer existed in what he called Russia's "dictatorship".
          Kasparov said at a press conference in June 2013 that if he returned to Russia he doubted he would be allowed
          to leave again, given Putin's ongoing crackdown against dissenters. "So for the time being," he said, "I
          refrain from returning to Russia." He explained shortly thereafter in an article for The Daily Beast that this
          had not been intended as "a declaration of leaving my home country, permanently or otherwise", but merely an
          expression of "the dark reality of the situation in Russia today, where nearly half the members of the
          opposition's Coordinating Council are under criminal investigation on concocted charges". He noted that the
          Moscow prosecutor's office was "opening an investigation that would limit my ability to travel", making it
          impossible for him to fulfill "professional speaking engagements" and hindering his "work for the nonprofit
          Kasparov Chess Foundation, which has centers in New York City, Brussels, and Johannesburg to promote chess in
          education".
          Kasparov further wrote in his June 2013 Daily Beast article that the mass protests in Moscow 18 months earlier
          against fraudulent Russian elections had been "a proud moment for me". He recalled that after joining the
          opposition movement in March 2005, he had been criticized for seeking to unite "every anti-Putin element in
          the country to march together regardless of ideology". Therefore, the sight of "hundreds of flags representing
          every group from liberals to nationalists all marching together for 'Russia Without Putin' was the fulfillment
          of a dream." Yet most Russians, he lamented, had continued to "slumber" even as Putin had "taken off the
          flimsy mask of democracy to reveal himself in full as the would-be KGB dictator he has always been".
          Kasparov responded with several sardonic Twitter postings to a September 2013 The New York Times op-ed by
          Putin. "I hope Putin has taken adequate protections," he tweeted. "Now that he is a Russian journalist his
          life may be in grave danger!" Also: "Now we can expect NY Times op-eds by Mugabe on fair elections, Castro on
          free speech, & Kim Jong-un on prison reform. The Axis of Hypocrisy."
          In a 12 May 2013 op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, Kasparov questioned reports that the Russian security
          agency, the FSB, had fully cooperated with the FBI in the matter of the Boston bombers. He noted that the
          elder bomber, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, had reportedly met in Russia with two known jihadists who "were killed in
          Dagestan by the Russian military just days before Tamerlan left Russia for the U.S." Kasparov argued, "If no
          intelligence was sent from Moscow to Washington" about this meeting, "all this talk of FSB cooperation cannot
          be taken seriously." He further observed, "This would not be the first time Russian security forces seemed
          strangely impotent in the face of an impending terror attack," pointing out that in both the 2002 Moscow
          theater siege and the 2004 Beslan school attack, "there were FSB informants in both terror groups – yet the
          attacks went ahead unimpeded." Given this history, he wrote, "it is impossible to overlook that the Boston
          bombing took place just days after the U.S. Magnitsky List was published, creating the first serious external
          threat to the Putin power structure by penalizing Russian officials complicit in human-rights crimes." In sum,
          Putin's "dubious record on counterterrorism and its continued support of terror sponsors Iran and Syria mean
          only one thing: common ground zero".
          Kasparov wrote in July 2013 about the trial in Kirov of fellow opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who had been
          convicted "on concocted embezzlement charges", only to see the prosecutor, surprisingly, ask for his release
          the next day pending appeal. "The judicial process and the democratic process in Russia," wrote Kasparov, "are
          both elaborate mockeries created to distract the citizenry at home and to help Western leaders avoid
          confronting the awkward fact that Russia has returned to a police state". Still, Kasparov felt that whatever
          had caused the Kirov prosecutor's about-face, "my optimism tells me it was a positive sign. After more than 13
          years of predictable repression under Putin, anything different is good."
          Kasparov had maintained a summer home in the Croatian city of Makarska. In February 2014, he applied for
          citizenship by naturalisation in Croatia, according to media reports, claiming he was finding it increasingly
          difficult to live in Russia. According to an article in The Guardian, Kasparov was "widely perceived" as
          having been a vocal supporter of Croatian independence during the early 1990s. Later in February 2014, his
          application for naturalisation was approved and he had a meeting with Croatian prime minister Zoran Milanović
          on 27 February. Croatian press cited his "lobbying for Croatia in 1991" as grounds for the expedited
          naturalisation. In an interview for a Croatian daily published in February 2022, Kasparov said he was "very
          grateful" to Croatian president Zoran Milanović for the help rendered by him (then as prime minister) in
          obtaining Croatian citizenship.
          On 20 May 2022, Kasparov was designated as "foreign agent" by the Ministry of Justice of the Russian
          Federation.
