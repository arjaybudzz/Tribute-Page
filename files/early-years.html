        <p id="paragraph">
          Kasparov was born on April 13, 1963 as Garik Kimovich Weinstein (Russian: Гарик Кимович Вайнштейн, Garik
          Kimovich Vainshtein) in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR (now Azerbaijan), Soviet Union. His father, Kim Moiseyevich
          Weinstein, was Jewish and his mother, Klara Shagenovna Kasparova, was Armenian. Kasparov has described himself
          as a "self-appointed Christian", although "very indifferent" and identifying as Russian: "[A]lthough I'm
          half-Armenian, half-Jewish, I consider myself Russian because Russian is my native tongue, and I grew up with
          Russian culture." Kasparov and his family had to flee anti-Armenian pogroms in Baku in January 1990 that were
          coordinated by local leaders with Soviet acquiescence.
          According to Kasparov himself, he was named after United States President Harry Truman, "whom my father
          admired for taking a strong stand against communism. It was a rare name in Russia, until Harry Potter came
          along."
          Kasparov began the serious study of chess after he came across a chess problem set up by his parents and
          proposed a solution. When Garry was seven years old, his father died of leukemia. At the age of twelve, Garry,
          upon request of his mother Klara and with the consent of the family, adopted Klara's surname Kasparov, which
          was done to avoid possible antisemitic tensions, which were common in the USSR at the time.
          From age 7, Kasparov attended the Young Pioneer Palace in Baku and, at 10 began training at Mikhail
          Botvinnik's chess school under coach Vladimir Makogonov. Makogonov helped develop Kasparov's positional skills
          and taught him to play the Caro-Kann Defence and the Tartakower System of the Queen's Gambit Declined.
          Kasparov won the Soviet Junior Championship in Tbilisi in 1976, scoring 7 points of 9, at age 13. He repeated
          the feat the following year, winning with a score of 8.5 of 9. He was being trained by Alexander Shakarov
          during this time.
          In 1978, Kasparov participated in the Sokolsky Memorial tournament in Minsk. He had been invited as an
          exception but took first place and became a chess master. Kasparov has repeatedly said that this event was a
          turning point in his life and that it convinced him to choose chess as his career. "I will remember the
          Sokolsky Memorial as long as I live", he wrote. He has also said that after the victory, he thought he had a
          very good shot at the World Championship.
          He first qualified for the Soviet Chess Championship at age 15 in 1978, the youngest-ever player at that
          level. He won the 64-player Swiss system tournament at Daugavpils on tiebreak over Igor V. Ivanov to capture
          the sole qualifying place.
          Kasparov rose quickly through the FIDE world rankings. Starting with oversight by the Russian Chess
          Federation, he participated in a grandmaster tournament in Banja Luka, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina (part of
          Yugoslavia at the time), in 1979 while still unrated (he was a replacement for the Soviet defector Viktor
          Korchnoi, who was originally invited but withdrew due to the threat of a boycott from the Soviets). Kasparov
          won this high-id tournament, emerging with a provisional rating of 2595, enough to catapult him to the top
          group of chess players (at the time, number 15 in the world). The next year, 1980, he won the World Junior
          Chess Championship in Dortmund, West Germany. Later that year, he made his debut as the second reserve for the
          Soviet Union at the Chess Olympiad at Valletta, Malta, and became a Grandmaster.
